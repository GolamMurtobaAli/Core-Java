1. What Is The Variable?
=>
Variable is a container where we can store different types of values in it.

2. How To Declare A Variable In Java?
=>
data_type variable_name;

data_type: This specifies the type of data the variable will hold.
variable_name: This is the name you choose for the variable.

int age;          // Declaring an integer variable named 'age'
double salary;    // Declaring a double variable named 'salary'
boolean isStudent; // Declaring a boolean variable named 'isStudent'
String name;      // Declaring a String variable named 'name'

3. How To Assign A Value To Variable?
=>
int x = 10;               // Declaring and initializing an integer variable
double pi = 3.14159;       // Declaring and initializing a double variable
boolean isWorking = true; // Declaring and initializing a boolean variable
String greeting = "Hello"; // Declaring and initializing a String variable

	
4. What Is Variable Initialization? How Is It Different Than Assignment?
=>
Variable Initialization:
a) Initialization refers to the process of giving a variable an initial value when it is declared.
int age = 25;  // The variable 'age' is declared and initialized with the value 25.
Variable Assignment:
a)Assignment involves changing the value of an existing variable by assigning it a new value.
int x;        // Variable 'x' is declared but not initialized.
x = 10;       // Variable 'x' is assigned the value 10 after declaration.
x = 20;       // Variable 'x' is reassigned the value 20.

5. Can We Declare And Initialize A Variable Together?
=>
Yes, you can declare and initialize a variable together in Java.

int age = 25;               // Declare and initialize an integer variable 'age'
double pi = 3.14159;       // Declare and initialize a double variable 'pi'
boolean isWorking = true; // Declare and initialize a boolean variable 'isWorking'
String name = "John";      // Declare and initialize a String variable 'name'

6. Why Is Specifying DataType Mandatory In Java?
=> 
Specifying the data type is mandatory in Java to provide strict type checking and improve program reliability and safety.
It allows the compiler to catch type-related errors at compile-time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.
